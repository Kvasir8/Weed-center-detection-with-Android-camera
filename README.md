# What you need
1. Python, Android phone with camera support, 'IP cam' app in its android.
2. Wi-Fi or any Wi-Fi network that supports LAN and is able to connect between PC and portable Android phone camera.

*Make sure that both PC and Android Phone is connected one another in the same Local Area Network and assigned proper Local IP.

Algorithms : Softmax + Deep Neural Net + Drop out + Adam optimizer + Mini batch + Relu

This program is designed to classfiy hand shapes with utilizing image recognition using python and openCV, and allows you to identify which hand action that you intend to. There are three classifications: zero & one & two, and each value is assigned to its own label. The principle explained in detail by following pictures and descriptions :
